  <!-- Our Mission Page -->
  <div id="missionPage" class="page hidden">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to bridge the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals by providing innovative live sign language detection technology.
      In today's world, real-time communication remains a challenge for those who rely on sign language, especially in situations where interpreters are unavailable or inaccessible.
      This communication barrier limits access to essential services, social interaction, and opportunities for individuals in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to break down these barriers by creating an inclusive and accessible environment through cutting-edge technology that can detect and translate sign language into spoken or written language in real time.
      By doing so, we aim to foster better understanding, collaboration, and seamless interaction between hearing and non-hearing individuals across all areas of life—from education and healthcare to business and social spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that live sign language detection will empower the Deaf community, promote inclusivity, and ensure that everyone, regardless of their hearing ability, can communicate effortlessly in any environment.

  <!-- How to Use Page -->

<div id="howToUsePage" class="page hidden">
  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <p>Welcome to 5enses Bridge! Here’s a quick guide on how to make the most of this application:</p>

  <h3>1. Navigating the App</h3>
  <p>
    Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to explore different sections of the website.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sign Page</strong>: This is the main feature where you can use the sign language detection tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Our Mission</strong>: Learn about the goals and purpose of 5enses Bridge.</li>
      <li><strong>Settings</strong>: Adjust app settings to personalize your experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Share your thoughts and suggestions with us.</li>
      <li><strong>How to Use</strong>: You’re here! This section explains how to use the website and its features.</li>
      <li><strong>ASL Resources</strong>: Find additional resources to learn or improve your ASL skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Meet The Creators</strong>: Get to know the team behind 5enses Bridge.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>2. Using the Sign Language Detection Tool</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Access the Tool</strong>: Go to the <strong>Sign Page</strong> by selecting it from the navigation bar.<br>
    <strong>Allow Camera Access</strong>: When prompted, grant the website access to your camera. This is necessary for the app to detect hand gestures.<br>
    <strong>Position Yourself</strong>: Ensure that your hand is clearly visible in the camera’s view. Position your hand in the center of the camera box, making sure it’s well-lit and in front of a plain background if possible for optimal detection.<br>
    <strong>Start Signing</strong>: Begin signing ASL gestures within the camera’s frame. The app will analyze your hand movements and positions in real time.<br>
    <strong>View Translations</strong>: As the app detects your gestures, the English translation of each recognized sign will appear below the camera feed. If the gesture is not recognized, it may display "Unknown Gesture" until the hand shape matches a known sign.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Interpreting the Results</h3>
  <p>
    The translation text below the camera feed will update based on the gesture detected.<br>
    <strong>Recognized Signs</strong>: If the app identifies a gesture, it will display the corresponding English word or phrase (e.g., "I Love You").<br>
    <strong>Unknown Gesture</strong>: If the app cannot identify the gesture, you may see "Unknown Gesture." Try adjusting the clarity of your hand position or consult the <strong>ASL Resources</strong> section for guidance on recognizable signs.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ensure Good Lighting</strong>: Make sure the room is well-lit so the camera can clearly see your hand.</li>
      <li><strong>Positioning</strong>: Keep your hand steady and fully visible in the frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Recognizable Signs</strong>: Some complex gestures may not be recognized without fine-tuning. Start with simple, commonly recognized signs, such as "Hello" or "Thank You."</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Permissions</strong>: If you accidentally denied camera access, check your browser settings to enable it again.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>5. Further Learning</h3>
  <p>
    Explore the <strong>ASL Resources</strong> section for additional tools, tutorials, and tips to improve your ASL proficiency.<br>
    Familiarize yourself with common ASL gestures to enhance the detection accuracy and make your experience with 5enses Bridge smoother and more effective.
